		<p> This is the story of Us; a group of young people from less privileged communities, who are blessed with immense talents and virtues, and who, motivated by the passion to discover and learn, undertook the path of education, determined to achieve their goals. Each step conquered is a testament to the perseverance and determination that characterizes each one of us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each one of us have a different story, but all of us have had to learn the art of discipline and recognize that talent alone is not enough for success. Talent without discipline is like a ship on the ocean without a compass or GPS. Climbing each step demanded hard and constant work, passion and resilience. Each failure opened opportunities. Each achievement was a call to persevere.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to attending our respective schools, every Saturday, every summer, and every Christmas break we attended the MACILE Academy, taking preparatory lessons to advance our learning. Some of us also studied English, making great strides and achieving competence in a short time.

			<p itemprop="about">
			This is our common story, that at different points in time each of us was admitted to the MACILE Summer Academy. We are also MACILE scholars. MACILE is an education program of Complex Systems Optimization Lab (COSOLA). It stands for Mathematics, Sciences, Engineering, and Language, in Spanish. MACILE is dedicated to advance engineering education in less advantaged communities. It has operated in our region of Itabo-San Gregorio de Nigua since 2007. MACILE nurtures the talents of young people from poor backgrounds, like us, who love math and seek to pursue studies and careers in STEM related fields.

        </h2>
        <p>Four and a half years ago, I started the university without a clear idea of what I wanted to
          study, but decided to take the step. I did not allow my doubts to stop me because I had the full knowledge of
          my willingness to learn.</p>
        <p>When I decided to study mechanical engineering, I received positive and negative
          comments. People who knew me said it was a good decision that fit my profile. Those who thought they knew me
          said they didn't see me in that field. However, I stayed firm and listened to wise advices.</p>
        <p>Now that I have finished, I would like to acquire 1 to 2 years of work experience
          before pursuing a master degree. Three areas I’m interested are: chemistry, materials and thermodynamics.
        </p>
        <p>I thank God infinitely for having been privileged. That's how I feel when I realize
          that I didn't miss anything. I always had my family, counselors and friends. I was never alone in the battle,
          I thank each of them, because they may not know that their support was a remedy for uncertainties and sorrows.
          My achievements are not so mine, they are ours.</p>

			<p>I am grateful I concluded with honors the technical high school degree with mention in Industrial Mechanic, at the Instituto Politécnico Loyola, San Cristóbal,RD. I also completed an internship at Maritíma Dominicana and currently study English at the American Dominican Cultural Institute. I plan to follow the SALVIA program with COSOLA then attend the university to study software engineering.</p>
			<p>In elementary school, I frequently received awards and felt happy. When I was admitted to a group where all were high achievers, I felt incompetent and discouraged. Many were better than me. I asked God for help and accepted that I had to try harder. I did it and it was difficult, but I managed to improve. I internalized Dr. Vargas's advice: "The main thing is not intelligence, but work." This is now my motto. I share it with those who feel how I felt because it has helped me overcome difficulties. “While my determination to achieve success is powerful enough, failure will not overwhelm me”- Og Mandino.

			<h2 class="post__our-journey_student">María De Los Angeles Guillén</h2>
			<p>MACILE opened the doors to the world of science and mathematics for me, which has been very useful in my school life. My older brother introduced me to MACILE. Motivated by his experience, I applied and was accepted to MACILE at the age of ten. The Summer Academy 2012 was extraordinary. I learned science and math in a dynamic and fun way. In 2014 I was invited to participate in the Saturday academy, and received a scholarship to pursue high school studies in Loyola. In 2018, I received a scholarship to study English at the Dominican American Cultural Institute. In Loyola, I collaborated with their tutoring program, participated in the organization of activities and in “Battle of the Tales”; I was also master of ceremony at the presentation of the book "Loyola Write 2019".</p>
			<p>Icompleted the technical high school degree with mention in electronic communication at the Loyola. I did an internship at Claro, Santo Domingo. I currently study English at the Dominican American Cultural Institute. I'm interested in economics, international relations, and diplomacy. My inmediate plan is to study economics while earning practical experience in technology in the SALVIA Apprenticeship Program.</p>

			<p>As a MACILE scholar and student, I had the responsibility of serving the community. I was a teacher and organizer of a MACILE summer camp for children from 6 to 12 years. With this same spirit of service, I was part of Loyola's tutoring program. I want to continue serving, by serving a 2-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After serving my mission, I want to study robotics and be a programmer of autonomous machines to help people who need assistance and help improve society.</p>
			<p>I graduated form the Instituto Politécnico Loyola in June 2019 with a technical high school degree, mention industrial electric. I completed a 3 months practical training program at Domicem, one of the larger cement producers in DR. I'm currently studying English at English Connect, a program sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and also completing a course in residential electric at Loyola. </p>
			<p>While preparing to serve my mission, I am advancing my learning in math, economics, and programing at SALVIA, a technology apprenticeship program of Comples Systems Optimization Lab.</p>

			<p>I have been recognized as applied and studious since elementary school. The fear of not being able to learn everything has motivated my efforts to obtain good results. In high school I struggled, but remained in the honor roll for 4 years. This period was transformative; I forged very strong bonds of friendship and created unforgettable memories. I learned about MACILE in the 2nd year of high school. I was excited to apply because I want to learn programming. My goal is to purse studies and career in computer science. I was accepted to the MACILE 2017 Summer Academy and received a scholarship to study English at the American Dominican. In MACILE I have learned to improve my academic performance and strengthen the spiritual side.</p>
			<p>I concluded with honors a technical high school degree with mention in information technology at the Instituto Politécnio de Haina (IPHA), Bajos Haina, DR. I currently study English at the Dominican American Cultural Institute in Santo Domingo. My step is to complete a 2-year program in software development at ITLA, starting in January 2020. My goal is to complete university level studies in computer programming with honors, learn languages, and study abroad. I longs to go to France.</p>
