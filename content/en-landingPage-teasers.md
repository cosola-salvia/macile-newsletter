Here, they reflect about their journeys, the milestones accomplished, and their's visions. Three of the high school graduates featured in this issue are members of the developer team that produced this first digital issue of the MACILE Newsletter, a further testament of their tenacity. 

## We Are The Adventurers; The real founders.
The MACILE Summer Academy is a rigorous five-week program for talented students in grades 6th to 12th who loves math and science. We piloted the Academy in July 2007 and 2008. This first issue of the Academy Bulletin highlights developments of these pilot programs, focusing on people that made possible their success, evolution of the curricula and activities, and the results. Most of the beautiful Dominican students and dedicated teachers that participated in 2007 and 2008 continued in the program for three or more years.
