# We are the adventurers—-the true founders

The MACILE Summer Academy is a rigorous five-week program for students in grades 6 to 12. The curriculum includes math, science, engineering, technology, and language. We designed the courses and activities to stimulate curiosity, creativity, and passion for learning; and to build the students’ skills, analytical abilities, and rational thinking. 
MACILE targets talented students in the top 20% of their class.  We piloted the program in July 207 and 2008.

## Objectives

- Nurture the creativity and curiosity of talented young people.
- Increase access to challenging and stimulating learning environments.
- Advance engineering education in K-12
- Increase learning and understanding.

## MACILE 2007 Summer Academy

Forty-seven students completed the 2007 MACILE Summer Academy. It lasted for three weeks and only included mathematics. Students attended from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Monday through Friday. We provided a healthy breakfast snack. At the end of the program, we celebrated with a barbeque.

### People that made a difference

Local educators helped us out by visiting the schools and helping select potential students. They provided MACILE space and also assisted with logistics.

## MACILE Summer Academy 2008

Based on the observations in 2007, we adjusted the 2008 MACILE Summer Academy. We extended the program to five weeks, and we redesigned the curriculum to include engineering, technology, Spanish literacy, in addition to math. We also added activities—chess, field trips, and guest speakers.

### About the 2008 Program

We admitted thirty-five students. We added a required orientation and a meeting with the parents before initiating the program.

We extended the school day from 12-4 PM and provided students with a healthy lunch in addition to breakfast. We gauged the students' mathematical and linguistic progress through a math test, and an evaluation questionnaire completed at the end of the program.

## MACILE Spanish Curriculum

An innovative active approach to deepen understanding of the language through the history and folklore of the Dominican Republic. Dr. Rosario Montelongo de Swanson wrote a book exclusively for MACILE.

### Los Indios De Quisqueya

Los Indios de Quisqueya, the accompanying history book and foundation of the MACILE curriculum, was donated by the Tavares Foundation. The author, Juan Tómas Tavares Kelnes, permitted its use.

_Students built toothpick bridges and learned about solar energy. This team is testing its bridge resistance._

_MACILE strives to expand the young people's horizons, nourishing their innate curiosity and wonderful imagination rather than discouraging them, as Einstein admonished_

## MACILE Scholarship Program

MACILE pre-college scholarships encourage academic excellence. The program increases opportunities for qualified young people from less advantaged backgrounds, who are interested in math, science, technology, and engineering to attend more challenging schools and pursue their dreams of education.

It's open to students in grades 7th to 12th who have participated in the MACILE Summer Academy. The amount of each scholarship varies depending on the school—each covers tuition (when applicable), uniform, books, supplies, and transportation costs. We hope to be able to offer 40-50 pre-college scholarships per year by 2012. 

The program was founded in 2008 with a generous donation from Buffalo Tungstein, Inc.

### First Scholars

MACILE granted five merit-based scholarships in 2008 to 9th-grade students from Itabo and San Gregorio de Nigua. School teachers and directors recommended them. The recommendations were green-lighted by community leaders who attested to the students' characters and needs.
