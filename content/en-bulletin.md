# We are the adventurers—-the true founders

The MACILE Summer Academy is a rigorous five-week program for students in grades 6 to 12. The curriculum includes math, science, engineering, technology, and language. We designed the courses and activities to stimulate curiosity, creativity, and passion for learning; and to build the students’ skills, analytical abilities, and rational thinking. 
MACILE targets talented students in the top 20% of their class.  We piloted the program in July 207 and 2008.

## Our objectives

MACILE has four core objectives:
- Nurture the creativity and curiosity of talented young people.
- Increase access to challenging and stimulating learning environments.
- Advance engineering education in K-12
- Intill passion for learning and understanding.

## About the students

In 2007, forty-seven students in grade 7th to 11th completed the Summer Academy. The students ranged in age from 12 to 18; 43% were female and 56% male. They came from five public schools. 

In 2008, we admitted thirty-five students to the MACILE Summer Academy, and all successfully completed the program. The students were in grade 6th to 9th; 44% were female and 66% male. They came from five public and private schools. 


## MACILE Summer Academy 2007  

The MACILE Summer Academy lasted for three weeks in 2007, and only included mathematics. Students attended from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Monday through Friday. We provided a healthy breakfast snack. At the end of the program, we celebrated with a barbeque.

### People that made a difference

Local educators and community leaders made the success of MACILE possible. They visited the schools to promote MACILE and encourage students participation. They provided the space for the program and assisted with logistics.

## MACILE Summer Academy 2008

Based on the observations in 2007, we adjusted the 2008 MACILE Summer Academy. We extended the program to five weeks, and redesigned the curriculum to include engineering, technology, Spanish literacy, in addition to math. We also added activities—chess, field trips, and guest speakers. Students attended from 8:00 AM to 3:30 PM and were provided with a healthy lunch in addition to breakfast.

### Students selection and evaluation

Conforming to the MACILE objectives, in 2008 we instituted more riguruous students selection and evaluation processes, aligning more closely with the goal of selecting students from the top 20% of their class who express interest in learning math and science. That year, thirty-five students from fifty-nine recommended were admitted to the MACILE Summer Academy. 

We added a required orientation and a meeting with the parents before initiating the program. At the end of the program, we employed particularly design evaluation instruments to gauge the students' mathematical and linguistic progress. We also evaluated the students' perception of learning and overal satisfaction with the program.

## MACILE Spanish Curriculum

The objective of this unique program is twofold: first, it seeks to improve the students’ command of the language, its grammatical structures and orthography; second, it seeks to instruct the student in Dominican culture, history, and literature. To fulfill this double objective, the curriculum includes a selection of Dominican texts that deal with the main roots of Dominican culture: Aboriginal, African and Spanish. The pilot program starts with the deepest root, the Taíno, based mainly on the text Los indios de Quisqueya by Juan Tomás Tavares K., and supplemented by additional material.

### About the author

The Spanish language program has been exclusively developed for MACILE by Dr. Rosario Montelongo de Swanson (link to college page), Professor of Language and Literature at Marlboro College.  “With this program I carry out my desire to contribute to the construction of a better future through youth education and returning to the community a little of how much I have been given as a woman and teacher.”

## MACILE Scholarship Program

The MACILE scholarship program seeks to improve academic achievement among talented young people from the Itabo - San Gregorio de Nigua región in the Dominican Republic, who are passionate about learning and have indicated interest in math and science.  The program increases their opportunities to pursue their preparatory education at top schools in the province.  We hope to encourage students from less-advantaged backgrounds to pursue studies and careers in math, science, technology, and engineering. 

The scholarship program is based on academic merit and is open to students in grades 7th to 12th who have participated in the MACILE Summer Academy._

The program was founded in 2008 with a generous donation from Buffalo Tungstein, Inc.

### First Scholars

MACILE granted five merit-based scholarships in 2008 to 9th-grade students from Itabo and San Gregorio de Nigua. School teachers and directors recommended them. The recommendations were green-lighted by community leaders who attested to the students' characters and needs.
