# We are the adventurers—-the true founders

The MACILE Summer Academy is a rigorous five-week program for students in grades 6 to 12. The curriculum includes math, science, engineering, technology, and language. We designed the courses and activities to stimulate curiosity, creativity, and passion for learning; and to build the students’ skills and logical abilities. 

MACILE targets talented students in the top 20% of their class.  We piloted the program in July 207 and 2008.

## Our objectives

MACILE has four core objectives:
- Nurture the creativity and curiosity of talented young people.
- Increase access to challenging and stimulating learning environments.
- Advance engineering, science, and math education in K-12
- Intill passion for learning and understanding.

## About the students

In 2007, forty-seven students in grade 7th to 11th completed the MACILE Summer Academy. They ranged in age from 12 to 18; 43% were female and 56% male. 

In 2008, we admitted thirty-five students to the MACILE Summer Academy, and all completed the program. The students were in grade 6th to 9th; 44% were female and 66% male.

The students came from five public and private schools. 

## MACILE Summer Academy 2007  

The MACILE Summer Academy lasted for three weeks in 2007, and only included mathematics. Students attended from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Monday through Friday. We provided a healthy breakfast snack. At the end of the program, we celebrated with a barbeque.

### People that made a difference

Local educators and community leaders made the success of MACILE possible. They visited the schools to promote MACILE and encourage students' participation. They also provided the space for the program and assisted with logistics.

## MACILE Summer Academy 2008

Based on the observations in 2007, we adjusted the 2008 MACILE Summer Academy. We extended the program to five weeks and redesigned the curriculum to include engineering, technology, Spanish literacy, in addition to math. We also added activities—chess, field trips, and guest speakers. Students attended from 8:00 AM to 3:30 PM and received a healthy lunch in addition to breakfast.

### Students selection and evaluation

In 2008, we instituted more rigorous student selection and evaluation processes, aligning more closely with the MACILE Summer Academy objectives to select students from the top 20% of their class who express interest in learning math and science. That year, we accepted thirty-five from fifty-nine students recommended. 

We added a required orientation and a meeting with the parents before initiating the program. At the end of the program, we gauged the students' mathematical and linguistic progress. We also evaluated their perception of learning and overall satisfaction with the program.

## MACILE Spanish Curriculum

An innovative active approach to improve the students’ command of the language, its grammatical structures, and orthography through a more in-depth understanding of the Dominican culture, folklore, history, and literature. The curriculum includes a selection of Dominican texts that deal with the primary roots of Dominican culture: Aboriginal, African, and Spanish. The pilot program starts with the deepest of them, the Taíno, based mainly on the text Los Indios de Quisqueya by Juan Tomás Tavares K., and supplemented by additional material.

The curriculum has been exclusively written for MACILE by Dr. Rosario Montelongo de Swanson, Professor of Language and Literature at Marlboro College.

## MACILE Scholarship Program

The MACILE scholarship program seeks to improve academic achievement among talented young people from the Itabo - San Gregorio de Nigua region in the Dominican Republic. It provides opportunities for youth passionate about learning, which indicates an interest in math and science, to pursue their preparatory education. We hope to encourage students from less-advantaged backgrounds to pursue studies and careers in math, science, technology, and engineering. 

The scholarship program is based on academic merit and is open to students in grades 7th to 12th who have participated in the MACILE Summer Academy._

The program was founded in 2008 with a generous donation from Buffalo Tungstein, Inc.

### First Scholars

MACILE granted five merit-based scholarships in 2008 to 9th-grade students from Itabo and San Gregorio de Nigua. School teachers and directors recommended them. The recommendations were green-lighted by community leaders who attested to the students' characters and needs.

# Comments & Acknowledgments 

We recognize the contributions and heartfelt comments of the people, companies, and communities that characterize MACILE. The are invaluable. Without them, improving the program and meeting its objectives would be difficult.

## From Our Students 

This program helped me fall in love with mathematics and language. It gave me new dreams and hopes. I have no words to express my gratitude to MACILE for bringing us what I like best, science, and for instilling in me a passion for learning.

This summer, I learned to read better, how to express my thoughts, and how to analyze problems...

I learned many examples of good behavior, capitalization...

I learned a lot about bridges, solar energy, mathematics, and other things. I also learned that I should not speak with a loud voice and not to disturb others. I also learned that working on a team is extremely important to achieve my goals.

I learned that I should ask questions when in doubt. If I remain silent, I will never learn what I need to learn.
