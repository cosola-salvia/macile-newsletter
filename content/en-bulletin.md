# We are the adventurers—-the true founders

The MACILE Summer Academy is a rigorous five week program for students in grades 6 to 12. The curriculum includes math, science, engineering, technology, and language. Courses and activities are designed to stimulate curiosity, creativity, and passion for learning; also to build the students’ skills, analytical abilities, and rational thinking. The program was piloted in July 2007 and 2008.

## MACILE 2007 Summer Academy

The 2007 MACILE Summer Academy lasted for three weeks and included mathematics only. Forty-seven students completed the program. They attended from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Monday through Friday, and a healthy breakfast snack was provided. We celebrated the end of the summer with a barbeque.

### Objectives

- Nurture the creativity and curiosity of talented young people.
- Increase access to challenging and stimulating learning environments.
- Advance engineering education in K-12
- Increase learning and understanding.

## MACILE Summer Academy 2008

Based on the observations in 2007, we adjusted the 2008 MACILE Summer Academy. It was extended to five weeks and we redesigned the curriculum to include engineering, technology, Spanish literacy, in addition to math. We also added activities—chess, field trips, and guest speakers.

### About the Students

Thirty-five students were admitted and completed the program. (MACILE targets talented students in the top 20% of their class.) There was a required orientation and a meeting with the parents .

### Schedule and Evaluation

We extended the school day from 12-4PM and provided students with a healthy lunch in addition to breakfast. We gauged the students' mathematical and linguistic progress through a math test, and an evaluation questionnaire completed at the end of the program.

## MACILE Spanish Curriculum

### Los Indios De Quisqueya

An innovative active approach to deepen understanding of the language through the history and folblore of the Dominican Republic. A book written exclusively for MACILE by Dr. Rosario Montelongo de Swanson.

Los indios de Quisqueya, the accompaning history book and foundation of the MACILE curriculum, was donated by the Tavares Foundation. The author, Juan Tómas Tavares Kelnes, permited its use.

_Students built toothpick bridges and learned about solar energy. This team is testing their bridge resistance._

_MACILE strives to expand the young people's horizons,nourishing their innate curiosity and wonderful imagination rather than discouraging them, as Einstein admonished_

_Visit from a Dominican business leader and a government official. They spoke about the job market and the government scholarship programs. Students learned about opportunities and requirements._

## First Scholars

MACILE granted five merit-based scholarships in 2008 to 9th-grade students from Itabo and San Gregorio de Nigua. School teachers and directors recommended them. The recommendations were green-lighted by community leaders who attested of the students' characters and needs.

## MACILE Scholarship Program

The program was founded in 2008 with a generous donation from Buffalo Tungstein, Inc.

MACILE pre-college scholarships encourage academic excellence. The program increases opportunities for qualified young people from less advantaged backgrounds, who are interested in math, science, technology, and engineering to attend more challenging schools and pursue their dreams of education.

The program began in 2008. It's open to students in grade 7th to 12th who have participated in the MACILE Summer Academy. The amount of each scholarship varies depending on the school—each covers tuition (when applicable), uniform, books, supplies, and transportation costs. We hope to be able to offer 40-50 pre-college scholarships per year by 2012.
